## ðŸŒ¿ What is the Green Agile Guide?

The Green Agile Guide bridges sustainability and agility across three core dimensions:

- **Ecological** â€“ Build code and systems that consume less, waste less, and last longer  
- **Economical** â€“ Make smarter decisions through lean principles and long-term thinking  
- **Social** â€“ Empower people, support team wellbeing, and build with ethical awareness

Weâ€™re actively working on the *Green Agile Guide* and would love to bring curious minds on board early.
